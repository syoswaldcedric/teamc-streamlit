Globally, energy efficiency and the use of cleaner fuels and technologies reduced carbon dioxide emissions per unit of value added by 13 per cent between 2000 and 2013.

Second, women's material position is not improved if the gap is closed either because menâ€™s pay has declined or if real wages are falling for both men and women. Figure i shows that, in the United Kingdom, although the gender pay gap narrowed after the financial crisis, real wages were falling for both women and men.",5,0,12,1,40

Researchers view labour market mismatches as one factor in weak employment trends and sluggish productivity improvements. At times, the skills demanded by employers are simply not available, because the vocational training system is weak and/or unresponsive to labour market needs. However, this depends on adequate knowledge of a country's supply and demand for skills.",9,1,2,0.333333333,42
